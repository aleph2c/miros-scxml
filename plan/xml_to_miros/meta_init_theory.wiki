  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.meta_init_theory|subgoals]])
    A simple theory for sending events across regional boundaries
   
    E0, E1, E3 will have a decent solution
    E2, will be deferred
    G3 will have a decent solution

  *What is the problem?*
    
    I have invented to mix the sending of events into a region and then to use
    that region's queue as a simple programming stack frame to program the
    INIT_SIGNAL handler.
    
    I don't have a simple theory of operation yet.  Once I have this then I can
    use this theory as a part of my XML port to manifest the parallel tag;
    creating generalized event handing across concurrent regions.

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.meta_init_theory|notes]])
    
    On January 30th, I create the hidden_dynamics diagram which describe how
    events are recursively constructed and how those events map to the specific
    part of the orthogonal regions which are being mapped into the parallel
    region mapping.
    
    Terminology: 
    
      *Injector:*  The state which puts then drives events through another
      orthogonal component.
      
      *Injectee*: The orthogonal component which receives events and is driven
      by another state machine's thread.

== Questions ==
  *Questions for Meta Init Theory: >= 5*
    Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?
    Do you have enough information?
    Is your information organized?
    Can you reproduce the problem?
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have something to baseline from?
    What recently changed?
    What don't you know that you need to know?

  *Idea/Hypotheses for Meta Init Theory: >=5*
  * [ ] The diagram you drew is correct
  * [ ] Render diagrams into pdf files so you can look at them elsewhere
  * [ ] Set up watch dog get docs working

  *Chosen Research-Goal/Hypothesis*
    
    The diagram you drew is correct
      * baseline your tests (get it working like it did before)
      * the injector part of the event is wrong, it only checks to see if a
        _state has a value, but then doesn't use it.  You can change the event
        construction to use a string to disprove each green dot on the diagram.
      * Disprove each theory using the previous paragraph for:
        * [ ] E0
        * [ ] E1
        * [ ] E3
