  *What is the problem?*

    A state function need to access it region's regions object.

    An injector state function needs to access the state functions of an inner
    regions object.  Any other state function needs to access the methods of the
    regions object that is driving event into its level.

    1:p_p11 (injector) -> regions['p_p11'] -> p_p11_s12
    2:p_p11_s12 -> regions['p_p11'] -> p_p11_s12 level

    Now we have these ideas:
    * outmost
    * outer (we have gotten used to this)

    We are missing something to describe machine hierarchy:
    * adam, foundation, outmost
    * parent, level_down, outer
    * sibling, level_same, same
    * child, level_up, inner -- for injectors

    For now we will go with the (outmost, outer, same, inner) group of
    descriptors.

    Currently you don't have a link to same, or inner.

    same should be set up by the link method
    inner is setup by convention, using the function's name

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.g1_WTF_event|notes]])

    * The meta events need to be pre-packed with enough information that the
      graphs doesn't have to know about itself in more than one place.  A search
      is expensive.

== Questions ==
  *Assumptions (at first invisible)*
    To find your assumptions, look for two peices of evidence that contradict
    each other. (may have to wait a couple of loops)

    * The graph search should be minimized, and auto-cached where every
      possible.

  *Questions for G1 WFT Event:*
  === Pre trouble-shooting questions ===
    * [ ] Do you have enough information?
    * [ ] Is your information organized?
    * [ ] Can you draw a diagram of the components and their interactions?
    * [ ] Do you need to write some code to make it easier to see?
    * [ ] Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?

    * [ ] Is it a repair or a pioneering problem?  Did it work once before, or did it
          work somewhere else?  Yes: Repair, No: Pioneering.

  === Repair (Complexity increases exponentially) ===
    * [ ] Can you test the individual components to reduce complexity?
    * [ ] Can you exchange components?
    * [ ] Can you reduce the number of interactions?
    * [ ] Are you continuing event though you know that something you have previously
          tested isn't working?
    * [ ] Has a thing you have previously tested fooled you into thinking it works,
          when it doesn't work? (Never assume something is right before you have
          checked it twice)

  == Pioneering ==
    * [ ] Has someone else solved this before (search)? Can you turn this into a
          repair?
    * [ ] Do you have something to baseline from?
    * [ ] Looking under the problem, are you focused on the right goals?  Are you
          stuck on solving a hard problem, when there is an easy problem?
    * [ ] Do you understand how your existing system works?  If not, can you draw
          diagrams and describe how it works before you continue?
    * [ ] What don't you know that you need to know?

  == Custom Questions (if there is a problem): (>=5) ==
    * [ ] How can I make the log appear in the right order, or how do I think
          about it differently so things are easier to debug?

  == Right now ==
    * [ ] what regions does the r in the first argument of the state function
          reference right now?  Why don't you know this off the top of your
          head?
