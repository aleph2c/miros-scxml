  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.state|subgoals]])
    Implimentation of all non-parallel state features of the state tag

  *What is the problem?*
    The problem is that I don't understand what they want yet and why they want
    it to be so complicated.  Also, there may be an issue with the python data
    model, there is no mention of it in the standard.

== Questions ==
  *Questions for State: >= 5*
    Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?
    Do you have enough information?
    Is your information organized?
    Can you reproduce the problem?
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have something to baseline from?
    What recently changed?
    What don't you know that you need to know?

  [[#Questions]]
  *Idea/Hypotheses for State: >=5*
  * [X] Fix parent recursion problem
  * [X] Add support for non-internal-signal transitions
  * [X] Fix issue where any transition causes the SCXML_INIT_SIGNAL to change
        state to the next state
  * [X] get state_test_initial_as_attribute.scxml working
  * [X] get state_test_initial_as_tag.scxml working
  * [X] allow for code in init signal with no transition (tag only)
  * [ ] add note in readme about how you do this and are (possibly) breaking the standard
  * [ ] disallow initial in tag if atom state
  * [ ] add meaningful exceptions, using existing python expections to the
        xml_to_miros package.
  * [ ] add default init test, even though this has been covered by the scxml
        test
  * [ ] add a note in the readme about how you will skip test364 because you
        don't support orthogonal regions yet
  * [ ] README.md adjustments:
    * [ ] Explain what SCXML_INIT_SIGNAL is and why it was invented
    * [ ] Explain that <log></log> converts to spy.scribble
    * [ ] Explain how the <debug/> tags works (extension)
    * [ ] Explain what unique does 
    * [ ] Explain why you allow code in the init tag
    * [ ] Explain why you raise SyntaxError when initial attribute in atomic
          state
  * [ ] Add feature to keep compiled code
