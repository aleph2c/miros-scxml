    Understanding of this element as it applies to the SCXML standard.  List
    work required for the xml to miros processor.
    
    Set up testing infrastructure for this node

  *What is the problem?*
    It's tied to another of other elements I don't understand yet.

  The SCXML document must have at least one [[state]], [[parallel]] or [[final]]
  child.  At the initialization time, the SCXML Processor must enter the
  states specified by the 'initial' attribute, if it is present.  If it is not
  present, the Processor must enter the first state in the document order.
  Platforms should document their default [[datamodel]].
  
  *Specification:*
  * [ ] If scxml has initial tag, start_at must work there.
  * [ ] Otherwise, start_at must run at the first state/final/parallel seen in
        the document
  * [ ] The "name" element must be the name of the active object
  * [ ] The "xmlns" must be set to "http:www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml"
  * [ ] The version must be set to "1.0"
  * [ ] The [[datamodel]] describes the datamodel for the chart, we will support
        "null" and something yet to be determined
  * [ ] "binding" can be "early" or "late", read
        [[https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#DataBinding|this] for details.  If the
        binding is "early" the SCXML processor must create all of the data
        elements and assign their initial values at the documentation
        initialization time.  If the binding is "late" the SCXML processor must
        create the data elements at documentation initialization time, but must
        assign the specified initial value to a given data ement only when the
        state the contains it, is entered for the first time, before any markup.
  * [ ] Children:
    * [ ] [[state]]
    * [ ] [[parallel]]
    * [ ] [[final]]
    * [ ] [[script]]
    * [ ] [[datamodel]] defines the datamodel
