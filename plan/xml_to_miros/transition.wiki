  * [X] Write test 403 by hand in the experiments folder
  * [X] You will have to add the active object internal signals to your template
  * [X] Find a way to give a signal name a "." in it
  * [X] Find a way to match a glob against a string for "*" events
  * [X] Add a recipe in miros for capturing globs
  * [X] Add a recipe in miros for capturing "." string events
  * [X] Add a recipe in miros for capturing tokens from events
  * [X] Find "*" in dict, create new state template, and use it when "*" is seen
  * [X] Find a way to map one shots into chart (look for delay attrib in send tag)
  * [X] Turn <send event="timeout.token1.token2" delay="1s"/> into
        self.post_fifo(Event(signal="timeout.token1.token2"),
          times=1,
          period=1.0,
          deferred=True)
  * [X] Find a way to pump a post_fifo into the xml chart (fifo/lifo) extension,
        write about this in the readme.
  * [X] Find a way to map multi shots into chart. add this to the readme
      * [X] 208 https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/208/test208.txml
  * [X] Find a way to cancel a specific one shot
  * [X] Find a way to [[https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#cancel|cancel all signals]] of a specific event
