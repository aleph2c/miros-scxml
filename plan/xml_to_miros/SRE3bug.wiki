  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.SRE3bug|subgoals]])

    A transition from middle resulting from the SRE3 event will not allow a
    transition into the p_s21 state, then an exit from the state, only then to
    climb into the correct final states.

    Creation of a true regression test to confirm the intermediate states as the
    system transitions from one set of states to another.  (without this,
    process will be slow and risky)

  *What is the problem?*
    It appears that the init code of the p_r2_region is allowing it to
    transition into the p_s21 state.  However a secondary mechanism fixes this
    transition and allows the system to setting into its final correct state.

  *Assumptions (at first invisible)*
    To find your assumptions, look for two pieces of evidence that contradict
    each other. (may have to wait a couple of loops)

  *Questions for SRE3 Bug*
  === Pre trouble-shooting questions ===
    * [ ] Do you have enough information?
    * [ ] Is your information organized?
    * [ ] Can you draw a diagram of the components and their interactions?
    * [ ] Do you need to write some code to make it easier to see?
    * [ ] Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?

    * [ ] Is it a repair or a pioneering problem?  Did it work once before, or did it
          work somewhere else?  Yes: Repair, No: Pioneering.

  === Repair (Complexity increases exponentially) ===
    * [ ] Can you test the individual components to reduce complexity?
    * [ ] Can you exchange components?
    * [ ] Can you reduce the number of interactions?
    * [ ] Are you continuing event though you know that something you have previously
          tested isn't working?
    * [ ] Has a thing you have previously tested fooled you into thinking it works,
          when it doesn't work? (Never assume something is right before you have
          checked it twice)

  == Pioneering ==
    * [ ] Has someone else solved this before (search)? Can you turn this into a
          repair?
    * [ ] Do you have something to baseline from?
    * [ ] Looking under the problem, are you focused on the right goals?  Are you
          stuck on solving a hard problem, when there is an easy problem?
    * [ ] Do you understand how your existing system works?  If not, can you draw
          diagrams and describe how it works before you continue?
    * [ ] What don't you know that you need to know?

  == Custom Questions: (>=5) ==
    * [ ] Are there other WTF events which also have broken intermediate states?
    * [ ] Did you break this with a recent code change?
