  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.xml_chart_3_diagram|subgoals]])
   
    Have a clear set of instructions for how to place an orthogonal region
    within a statechart using the Miro Samek algorithm and the miros python
    library.
    
    These instructions will make it possible to implement the good parts of the
    SCXML standard.
    
  *What is the problem?*
  
    The xml chart diagram, describes features that aren't available within the
    miros library.  It contains orthogonal regions, which will be manifested
    with an orthogonal component strategy.
    
    We need to solve a general form of this diagram so we need to make sure the
    seed design is streamlined as much as possible.  If you start with a bad
    architecture, you will end up in hell.
    
    There are signal dynamics which break the orthogonal bounds between states
    -- see WTF signals.  Ensure your software can manage these signals.

  *Idea/Hypotheses for Xml Chart 3 Diagram: >=5*
  * [ ] Find a way to reflect on the current active states
  * [ ] Implement a few of the WTF signals on xml_chart_3.  See if you can find
        a simple pattern for doing this.
  * [ ] Consider leaving the orthogonal region to orthogonal component strategy
        for another one: see concurrent charts with publish/subscribe mappings
  * [ ] Clean up the instrumentation stream it's a mess
  * [ ] Find a way to leave and enter orthogonal regions recursively so that
        your topological pictures can be applied
  * [ ] Create a comprehensive diagram to capture all topological targets
