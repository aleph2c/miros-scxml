  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.parallel_example_4|subgoals]])
    Build a working comprehensive example of parallel regions using othogonal
    components.

    Build up the basic regression test.

  *What is the problem?*
    The rr.fns dict makes it hard to debug, unwind this
    * [X] place a marker about where you are right now
    * [X] turn the regression back on
    * [X] unwind the  rr.fns
    * [X] rerun regression
    * [X] go back to marker
    * [ ] add pytests instead of inline testing.

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.parallel_example_4|notes]])
    The use of the rr.fns dict has made it harder to troubleshoot problems
    because I can not grep and search for the functions I want to search for
    directly.
