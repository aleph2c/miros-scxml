  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.parallel_example_4|subgoals]])
    A working F1 event.  Causing a transition from p_p11_s22 to p_p12_p11_s12
    and from p_s21 to p_p22_s11.

  *What is the problem?*
    Currently the bottom part of the chart is not working.  The F1 doesn't cause
    a transition from p_s21 to p_p22_s11.

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.parallel_example_4|notes]])

    The use of the rr.fns dict has made it harder to troubleshoot problems
    because I can not grep and search for the functions I want to search for
    directly.  Try to make your code grep-able.
