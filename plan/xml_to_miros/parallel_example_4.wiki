  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.parallel_example_4|subgoals]])

    A simplified 4th_example.py with a double F1.
    Eventually, I would like a I1 event working.

  *What is the problem?*

    I fooled myself into thinking the F1 event was working before.  I included a
    BOUNCE_SAME_META_SIGNAL event within it.  This event was not needed, no
    bounce or complicated mechanism was required.  But the code is full of
    over-complicated mechanisms.

    * The complicated code is not needed right now, but it might be needed for
      I1
    * The code is overly complicated

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.parallel_example_4|notes]])

    G coming from an inner region may be different from a G coming from a state.
    This might warrent the creation of a new letter in your topological
    lettering.  The difficult you face now is that you think you are porting one
    solution, but you are actually pioneering another method.

    Tools:
    ps(_e)
    r.outmost.rqs()

    *Warning*

    Since the state functions are decoratored, it is very tricky to compare the
    using the '==' operator.  Technically speaking, a decorated function and its
    naked version are not equivalent.  To avoid what could be a very nasty and
    hard to track bug, compare the string names of function not the functions
    directly.

    *Future Goals*:

      If you are tired, pick an easy goal, if you are fresh pick a hard goal

      *Easy Goals:*
      * [ ] Remove references to outmost for final_signal_name handling, use
            same, inner or outer attributes instead. (figure out which is
            appropriate)
      * [ ] Understand how the logging system works for working WTF events.
      * [ ] Find a way to make E2 handling consistent with the other WTF events
            in the system. (see p_p12)
      * [ ] Add a filter function which will accept a list of string which will
            work with the token_match, to let or stop events from being injected
            into an inner parallel region.
      * [ ] Integrate build_onion into meta_init
      * [ ] Integrate meta_init into meta_trans

      *Harder Goals:*
      * [ ] Refactor the logging system to be intuitive.
      * [ ] Need a mechanism to clear the graph's cache.  This will be needed
            when an XML diagram is being used to over-write and inner part of a
            program.
      * [ ] Construct new topological graph, with and without duplicate WTF
            events.

    Region notes:

    The use of the rr.fns dict has made it harder to troubleshoot problems
    because I can not grep and search for the functions I want to search for
    directly.  Try to make your code grep-able.

  *Assumptions (at first invisible)*
    To find your assumptions, look for two peices of evidence that contradict
    each other. (may have to wait a couple of loops)

  *Questions for :*

  === Pre trouble-shooting questions ===
    * [ ] Do you have enough information?
    * [ ] Is your information organized?
    * [ ] Can you draw a diagram of the components and their interactions?
    * [ ] Do you need to write some code to make it easier to see?
    * [ ] Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?

    * [ ] Is it a repair or a pioneering problem?  Did it work once before, or did it
          work somewhere else?  Yes: Repair, No: Pioneering.

  === Repair (Complexity increases exponentially) ===
    * [ ] Can you test the individual components to reduce complexity?
    * [ ] Can you exchange components?
    * [ ] Can you reduce the number of interactions?
    * [ ] Are you continuing event though you know that something you have previously
          tested isn't working?
    * [ ] Has a thing you have previously tested fooled you into thinking it works,
          when it doesn't work? (Never assume something is right before you have
          checked it twice)

  == Pioneering ==
    * [ ] Has someone else solved this before (search)? Can you turn this into a
          repair?
    * [ ] Do you have something to baseline from?
    * [ ] Looking under the problem, are you focused on the right goals?  Are you
          stuck on solving a hard problem, when there is an easy problem?
    * [ ] Do you understand how your existing system works?  If not, can you draw
          diagrams and describe how it works before you continue?
    * [ ] What don't you know that you need to know?
