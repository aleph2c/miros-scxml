  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.parallel_example_4|subgoals]])
    Build a working comprehensive example of parallel regions using othogonal
    components.

    A working E0 event

  *What is the problem?*
    It looks like the p_11 state initializes, and enters it's default init
    transitions, then exits and performs the E0 transition.

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.parallel_example_4|notes]])
    The use of the rr.fns dict has made it harder to troubleshoot problems
    because I can not grep and search for the functions I want to search for
    directly.
