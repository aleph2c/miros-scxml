  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.parallel_example_4|subgoals]])

    Need to understand META_INIT and META_EXIT (write them up)


    *paused*
    Giving a starting condition which included p_s21, a working G1 event:

    * [ ] G1 will have to push p_r1 in p_r1_under_hidden_region
    * [ ] G1 will cause a transition to
          the two desires substates of r2 on the graph

    Move through the nine lives quickly:
    * [X] setup
    * [X] investigate F2 Meta exit
    * [X] determine if it has enough to accomplish goal 1

*What is the problem?*


  You are forgetting what the new events do and why they exist.  Your docs are
  too long winded; *make them more like cheat sheets than proper documentation*.

  Once the right pictures describe what is going on, things should get a lot
  easy.

  *Discoveries:* ([[notes.parallel_example_4|notes]])

    The use of the rr.fns dict has made it harder to troubleshoot problems
    because I can not grep and search for the functions I want to search for
    directly.  Try to make your code grep-able.

    Having regions with the same names as functions is extremely confusing.  It
    would be good to name the regions as regions and the functions as functions.

    [hint]
    p_r2_region is getting the meta trans event, but with the wrong internal
    payload.  Or, it hasn't been sent the right payload yet, but the driving
    process has shut off before it is done.

    [hint]
    In p_p11_s22 the rr.outer.post_fifo(_e) is calling a different method than
    in p_s21 r.outer.post_fifo(_e).

    [de-aggregation]
    I had many problems, pulled out the easy ones first them removed them.  It
    took a long time to identify that this was happening though.

    [isolation/simplification]
    On the last remaining harder problem, removed half of the feature and only
    focused on the part that wasn't working.  Do more of this in the future.

  *Assumptions*

    I assumed that the self.temp.fun and self.state.fun of an HSM would be set
    to the function name of the state function while it was handling its
    INIT_SIGNAL.  This isn't true.  I'm not sure if this is a bug, or just how
    the event processor works. [found during the F1 investigation]

  *Mistakes*

    A force_region_exit must happen after a META_EXIT.  I made this mistake
    because I forgot the signal existed, I remembered there was some such way of
    initializing the orthogonal component because I forgot about the details,
    and just used the first thing I could think about.  More docs would help
    here, but I don't now what to write yet.
