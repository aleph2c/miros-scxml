  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.E0_WTF_event|subgoals]])
    The E0 WTF Event is automatically constructed given a target state
    We would have an example of a onion event for E0

    Adjust Region so it knows the name of its region state

  *What is the problem?*
    Currently, the state chart needs to know a lot about the topology.

  *Idea/Hypotheses for E0 Wtf Event: >=5*
  * [X] Create a test
  * [ ] Adjust Region so it knows the name of it's under/over hidden names and
        the name of its region
  * [ ] Show what needs to be built for a E0 WTF event
  * [ ] Find a way for an inner region to report on it's outer region
  * [ ] Recurse this process outward until you can build onion meta events for
        this scenerio.
  * [ ] Write it into the docs
